# To-Do App

This repository contains a simple Todo application built using React and Redux, featuring Redux Persist for local data persistence. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by marking them as completed, deleting them, and filtering the tasks based on their completion status. It also provides a separate "To-Do" list where users can easily mark tasks as completed.
